a record :[n]->C interpreted as a looping :Z/nZ->C
hence, a class function

Z/pZ has p representations of degree 1, Hom(Z/pZ,GL~1~(C))
extend each rep, r, to C^Z/pZ^ by  f->\sum_t in Z/pZ_ f(t)r(t)
extend each class function, f, by  r->\sum_t in Z/pZ_ f(t)r(t)
hence, p f = trace( \sum_r in Hom(Z/pZ,GL~1~(C))_ f(r)r^*^ )

when |n|>1 not prime power
 Z/nZ ~ Z/aZ x Z/bZ for some |a|,|b|>1
 so
  |n|=|a||b|
  Hom(Z/nZ,GL~1~(C)) ~ Hom(Z/aZ x Z/bZ,GL~1~(C)) ~ Hom(Z/aZ,GL~1~(C)) T Hom(Z/bZ,GL~1~(C))
  	T stands for \bigotimes
  	interpreting GL~1~(C) as embedded in M~1~(C), a ring with + and t (\littleotimes); acting on left, on a VS that is a right C module 
 anyways,
  if c in Hom(Z/aZ,GL~1~(C)) and d in Hom(Z/bZ,GL~1~(C)) are irreducible reps, then c t d is.
  if e in Hom(Z/aZ x Z/bZ,GL~1~(C)) is irreducible, it is iso to c t d for some c in Hom(Z/aZ,GL~1~(C)), d in Hom(Z/bZ,GL~1~(C)).
 in any case,
  characters are the same: trace(c t d) = trace(c)trace(d) and trace is a class function.
 if a is not prime, apply decomposition to Hom(Z/aZ,GL~1~(C)).
 if b is not prime, apply decomposition to Hom(Z/bZ,GL~1~(C)).
 otherwise have a party i guess, maybe arrange the components some way that makes you happy.

point is, that-
 if you have a function on Z/nZ,
