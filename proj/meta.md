Motivation
I want(ed) to make music with record(ing)s. Various computer applications exist.

Most, many, and all i've encountered provide a 'GUI' natigated via point-click-drag. Not the interface I envision, nor accessible[^1]. There's a lot of magic that seems to go on behind the scenes and that freaks me the fuck out.

Also, I was very sad when I plugged in an analog keyboard to the USB port on my Mac and couln't associate arbitrary sounds to keys (112 buttons, 1 wheel), not to mention, exercising options.

So real device interface does not always coincide with application interface.

EFFECTs

need a live programmable interface to speaker channels.
