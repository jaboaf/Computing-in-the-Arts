> does not contain the sampled audio data, it contains only the instructions needed by a synthesizer to play the sounds.
> These instructions are in the form of MIDI messages, which instruct the synthesizer which sounds to use, which notes to play, and how loud to play each note.
> The actual sounds are then generated by the synthesizer.

The synthesizer receiving the MIDI data must generate the actual sounds.[^1]

MIDI
 *protocol* provides a standardized and efficient means of conveying musical performance information as electronic data.[^1]
 *information* is transmitted in "MIDI messages", which can be thought of as instructions which tell a music synthesizer how to play a piece of music.[^1]
 *data stream*
  is a unidirectional asynchronous bit stream at 31.25 Kbits/sec. with 10 bits transmitted per byte (a start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit)[^1]
  is usually originated by a MIDI controller, such as a musical instrument keyboard, or by a MIDI sequencer. [^1]
 *interface* on a MIDI instrument will generally include three different MIDI connectors, labeled IN, OUT, and THRU.[^2]
  these are 5-pin DIN jacks
 *controller* is a device which is played as an instrument, and it translates the performance into a MIDI data stream in real time (as it is played).
 *sequencer* is a device which allows MIDI data sequences to be captured, stored, edited, combined, and replayed.
 *sound generator* or *sound module*, which will receive MIDI messages at its MIDI IN connector, and respond to these messages by playing sounds.
  many MIDI keyboard instruments include both the keyboard controller and the MIDI sound module functions within the same unit

MIDI Messages
cmd byte|name|param bytes| blah | blah
----|------|----|---
8_  |NoteOff| 2| Note# |Velocity 
9_  |NoteO | 2| Note# |Velocity
A_  |Key Pressure| 2 | Note# |pressure
B_  |Control Change|2| Controller# | value| used to control synthesizer function(s), on a given channel. 
C_  |Program Change|2| Program#| specify the type of instrument which should be used to play sounds on a given Channel
D_  |Channel Pressure|2| pressure|
E_  |Pitch Bend |2 |LSB?| MSB?
velocity unit is m/s, pressure unit is pascal = N/m^2 = kg/(ms^2) = J/m^3 


# Synthesizer Basics
Polyphony
- (of a sound generator) refers to its ability to play more than one note at a time
- measured/specified as a number of notes or voices.
A sound generator is polyphonic if it can play more than one note at a time

Sounds
- different sounds that a synthesizer or sound generator can produce are sometimes called "patches", "programs", "algorithms", or "timbres".
- Programmable synthesizers commonly assign "program numbers" (or patch numbers) to each sound.
-association of all patch numbers to all sounds is often referred to as a patch map.

Multitimbral
-(synthesizer or) sound generator is multitimbral if it is can produce two or more **different instrument** sounds simultaneously
- polyphony of a multitimbral synthesizer is usually allocated dynamically
- some sounds on some synthesizers use more than one "voice", so the number of notes which may be produced simultaneously may be less than the stated polyphony of the synthesizer
